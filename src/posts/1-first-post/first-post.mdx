# Welcome to my Developer Blog

Hello! Welcome to my software developer blog. Go with me on my journey - the idea is for me to help you
move forward in your developer endevors as I pull you into my experience and knowledge.

My goal is to have you do less but with greater focus and structure. And just the correct amount of 
understanding so you can be a great developer! 

Spend less time arguing and get a fundamental understanding of the how the tools, frameworks, and general
the process of creativity - from my eyes- work.


### A bit about me 

I got my first computer when I was 12 and always wanted to be the next ... blah blah blah just joking! 
I wont really dive into that. I have a background in computer science - with emphasis on biology. 
I have worked in industry - and contracted - currently looking for a new job. 

I like to break down tech - and have a good day programming everyday! I love teaching so hence this 
blog. I am an avid believer that with deliberate practice and repetition we can become better at our
craft. I also believe that the more we get stuck while solving problems - the better we become at solving
problems.
