# Brief introduction to Gatsby and React JS 

This is going to briefly explain the working tool kit of how to set up a Gatsby/React static app.

My tool chain includes: nodeJS server running and displaying all the scripts. React.js on the front
end to process all the components. Next, I am utilizing the MDX core library - that accepts strings and 
exports JSX strings that represent a component. This allows me to come up with a basic template for my 
blog and then export it to JSX (syntactic sugar for React). 

Finally, I am utilizing my source control and Gatsby to orchestrate the deployment of my application. 
Anytime a check in is made - Gatsby runs a build and connects to the live site on the domain.
